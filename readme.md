# Recicle - GDSC Solution Challenge 2023

## Synopsis
This project was prepared to solve a local problem using Google technologies, in accordance with one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

## Problem statement

Background: Angola, like many other countries around the world, is facing challenges in effectively managing and disposing of waste. The improper disposal of waste, particularly plastic waste, has led to severe environmental degradation, including polluted rivers and seas, contaminated soil, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling is an effective way to mitigate these negative impacts, but Angola currently faces obstacles in promoting the sale of recyclable waste.

Problem: The problem is that there is a lack of awareness and access to appropriate waste management practices, resulting in low levels of recycling and the inadequate sale of recyclable waste in Angola. Specifically, the following issues have been identified:

- Lack of knowledge: Many people in Angola are unaware of the importance of recycling and the proper way to organize and dispose of recyclable waste. As a result, they often mix recyclable and non-recyclable waste, which makes it difficult for recyclers to sort and process the waste effectively.

- Inefficient collection: There is a lack of readily available locations containing recyclable waste, which makes it difficult for recyclers to collect and transport the waste efficiently. This leads to higher transportation costs and lower profitability for waste buyers.

- Inadequate waste collection points: Waste collection points are not easily accessible to waste buyers, making it challenging for them to purchase recyclable waste. This is particularly true in rural areas where the nearest collection point may be far away.

- Limited payment options: There are few safe and convenient payment options available for waste buyers, which can be a significant barrier to purchasing recyclable waste. This is particularly true for small-scale waste buyers who may not have access to traditional banking services.

- Lack of regular supply: Waste buyers often struggle to find a regular and predictable supply of recyclable waste, making it difficult for them to plan and maintain their business operations.

Objectives: To address these issues, the following specific objectives have been identified:

- Increase awareness and improve waste management practices by educating the public on the importance of recycling and the proper way to organize and dispose of recyclable waste.

- Identify and map locations containing recyclable waste to allow for more efficient collection and transportation.

- Inform the public about the main waste collection points and make them easily accessible to waste buyers.

- Provide safe and convenient payment options for waste buyers, including payment by reference (MSEXPRESS).

- Facilitate the regular and predictable purchase of recyclable waste by allowing for a monthly subscription service for waste buyers.

Expected outcomes: By achieving these objectives, the sale of recyclable waste in Angola is expected to increase, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious society. In addition, the increased demand for recyclable waste is expected to create new economic opportunities for waste collectors and buyers, particularly small-scale businesses in rural areas. Furthermore, the improved waste management practices are expected to reduce environmental degradation and promote a cleaner and healthier environment for all Angolans.

### General target
- To boost the sale of recyclable waste in Angola.

### Specific Objectives
- Educate users on the proper way to organize waste.
- Identify locations containing recyclable waste.
- Inform about the main (closest) waste collection points.
- Enable payments by reference (MSEXPRESS).
- Allow for a monthly subscription for waste buyers.

## What are the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals?
Created by the United Nations in 2015, with support from all 193 United Nations Member States, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals aim to end poverty, ensure prosperity, and protect the planet.

## Challenge Description
[Google Solution Challenge 2023](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge)

A remarkable opportunity for students to showcase their innovation and creativity in building solutions that address real-world problems using technology, the Google Solution Challenge is an initiative organized by Google Developers and the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) program to encourage students from around the world to work in teams and solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time. The challenge provides a platform for students to showcase their technical skills, collaborate with their peers, and make a positive impact in their communities.

The Challenge invites students to form teams of up to four members and submit their project proposals, which should be innovative and address a social, economic, or environmental challenge. The proposals can be based on any of the Google technologies, including but not limited to, Cloud, Android, Flutter, TensorFlow, and Firebase.

Once the project proposals are submitted, a panel of judges will evaluate them based on criteria such as creativity, impact, feasibility, scalability, and technical implementation. The top ten teams will be selected as finalists and will receive mentoring from Google experts to develop their projects further.

Finally, the top three teams will be selected as winners, and they will receive prizes, including Google devices, vouchers, and most importantly, the recognition of their hard work and innovation.

The Google Solution Challenge 2023 is not just a competition; it's an opportunity for students to make a real difference in their communities and the world. It's a chance to bring their ideas to life and to contribute to building a better future through technology. Additionally, it's a chance to learn from industry experts, network with other students and professionals, and gain valuable skills that will benefit them in their careers.

In summary, It is highly recommend that students take part in the Google Solution Challenge 2023. It's an incredible opportunity to showcase their skills and creativity, learn from industry experts, and make a positive impact on the world. Let's celebrate and appreciate this initiative that will undoubtedly help in shaping a better future.
